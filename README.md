The objective for this project is to learn to develop visualizations and reports using R.  
I have created linked multiple visualizations and dashboards into a single Story Point to describe the economic situation across multiple dimensions in the US before, during and after the Great Recession. 
I have defined the Great Recession in the US to be from December of 2007 through June of 2009. 
Some of the dimensions included are  
         Fed lowered interest rates
         Stock Market crash
         Drop in Dollar value
         Bank Failures
Effects discussed on the great recession are
         Effect on Employment Rate
         Effect on Deliquecy Rate
         Effect on Output in manufaturing, electric and gas industry
         Effect on Capacity Utilization Rate
         Effect on Construction Sector
